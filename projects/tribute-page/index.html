          <h2 class="h3">Who is Robert Johnson?</h2>
          <p>
            While very little is known about the man himself, Robert Johnson
            became a legend. He was rumored to have made a deal with the devil,
            which gave him, initially a mediocre musician, the ability to play
            the blues like no one had before. Though his life was cut short, his
            music lived on to inspire and influence future generations.
